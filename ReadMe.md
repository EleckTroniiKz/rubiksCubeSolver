this project was implemented for the Module Programming Languages of the Bachelors Degree Computer Science at the DHBW LÃ¶rrach.

The goal of this project, was to implement a rubiks cube solver. The approach which was taken here, is the basic approach of the easiest algorithms. 

THis project was not implemented efficiently and contains a lot of code. But the goal was not to have an efficient Rubiks Cube solver, the goal was to implement the way most people approached the rubiks cube. 

For this project google was not used to implement the algorithm.
